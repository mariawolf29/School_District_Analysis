With these data changed, this is how the results changed:

- for the district summary overall passing was decreased by one percent, math by 0,1% and reading did not change. Out of 39,170 students, ninth graders from Thomas High School count for only 461 students. This is why leaving their performance hadn't affected it significantly.

- for the school summary, leaving out ninth graders affected math and reading score only slightly but we can see significant decrease in overall passing, from 90% to 65%. 

- Changing data put Thomas High Shool on Overall Passing lever for the district, which is 64%
